This is a PsychoPy implementation of the pattern glare test, including questions specifically targeted at participants with synesthesia. It is mainly based on the description found in [this article by Ward, J., Hoadley, C., Hughes, J. et al from 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep41155).

The author of this project, Lowe Wilsson, does not take credit for the test itself, only the implementation of it.
